# Visualization-of-Sorting-Algorithms
### Visualization of how sorting algorithms work. Displaying Data vs Index graph for real-time sorting in GIF.

consider a dataset that is linearly taken for visual purpose and the index starts at 0.
i.e. [1,2,3,4,...,n]

_Now shuffle this dataset and then sort the data with different algorithms.
For simplicity when we study sorting algorithms we divide it's operation into passes.
Plot the current dataset (Data Vs Indices, in X vs Y fashion) at every pass the algorithms make.
Now, combine the plots using an online video or gif tool (Giphy) and voila you can actually see where every algorithms get's it's name from_
